# Diversity-Analysis
You have recently joined an up and coming start-up ‘Wordoid’ as an HR manager. You have been allotted the task of looking after workforce requirements and employee satisfaction. Now as a wellinformed HR manager, you feel that diversity within the company is a very important aspect and helps the company in productivity and long-term growth. To ensure this, your first task as an HR manager is going to be to analyse the industry data in order to benchmark the job category-wise diversity levels in terms of gender and race. After this, you need to analyse and improve the performance of the employees. To accomplish this, you will look through the internal organisation data and look for factors impacting the performance. Further, you will understand what factors lead to the attrition of employees and how to reduce that.
